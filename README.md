# sublime-config

This is my [SublimeText3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) config. (OSX)

To use this, clone the repository into the User directory in the packages folder (/**User**/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages). Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) and run Package Control: Upgrade/Overwrite All Packages from the command pallete (Ctrl+Shift+P). This will install all the packages.
